Script was developed and used for Tender Drilling jumper hoses calculation. Need to establish reference plane, for purpose of insert in CAD drawing make it a bit more complicated than it is necessary.

"DXF" - plot of catenary curve is produced with equal scale along "x" - and "y" - axis. However, it should be checked on import into CAD system.

Script comes with **ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY**.
